1. The most important thing I learned in this workshop is casting. I 
think that it is important to know how to change datatypes to suit your 
needs, like I did in this lab where I used it to print the remaining 
balance properly.

2. You must add .005 to the GST because this will stop the C compilier 
from rounding the 13% tax down to 12%.

3. The result of a casting operation is the change of a datatype

4. I think I was required to use the modulus operator to learn how 
powerful it is. It came very handy when I was calculating the remaining 
balance left.
