1) Structs are better to use than parallel arrays because you can easily refer to each 
element in a struct because each variable or array defined in the struct is linked to the 
defined struct name. Parallel arrays are only linked by the data that they contain, which 
means that it would become more complicated to create similar data using parallel arrays 
because the programmer would have more work to do as they have to manually recreate each 
array individually. 
2) A struct datatype is better defined in a header because a header file can easily be used 
by multiple files. It makes the code more modular and versatile because a programmer can make 
changes in the struct which each file that includes the header file.
