1) My arrays in this program are not declared to hold 10 elements, but 
rather the amount that the user chooses.
2) Advantages of matching arrays is that they are easy to use. One 
disadvantage of matching arrays is that data might be confused when 
referencing them.
3) The at home portion of this workshop is too easy because it was very 
similar to work I have already completed in this class.
